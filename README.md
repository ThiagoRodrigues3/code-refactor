## ðŸ›  Task
```
I was tasked with Refactoring code and consolidating CSS elements to make a more precise and concise code for faster execution and a cleaner overall code aesthetic while maintaining website appearance and functionality. 
```

## ðŸ’» Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.

## ðŸ’¡ Information Given by Client

### ðŸ–¥ User Story

```
As a marketing agency
I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
So that our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### ðŸ“ƒ Acceptance Criteria

```
Given a webpage meets accessibility standards
When I view the source code
Then I find semantic HTML elements
When I view the structure of the HTML elements
Then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
When I view the icon and image elements
Then I find accessible alt attributes
When I view the heading attributes
Then they fall in sequential order
When I view the title element
Then I find a concise, descriptive title
```
